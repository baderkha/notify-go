Notify Go is a **free** command line / sdk that allows you to easily send (bot style) messages to a recipient . This features a base implementation for all your favourite messaging platforms 

like :
-  telegram 
-  discord 
-  slack 

**Note**: *this is not a 2 way messaging protocol . This project only publishes messages*

It's aimed to be super minimal with only a single method to call in order to make the dev experience as simple as possible.

This solution is great for the following scenarios :
- Command Line Notifications
- System Notifications
- IOT Devices
- Home Automation
